Idea 1: Use morphology transformations and filters. 

	1.1. Use dialation, opening, and other morphology transformation, but failed. 

	1.2. Use high-pass filter to enhance the details in the image. (maybe can use low-pass filter to reduce the noise, but with the risk to eliminate the wire as well). 

		 Comment: the result from high-pass filter looks fine. it highlight the lines in the image to some degree. maybe can apply some contrast enhancement, 
			      edge detection, Laplacian operator, or hough line detection. Additionally, maybe the filter than can remove the background noise can be used. 

	1.3. tried the line detection after high-pass filter, but failed. 

		 Comment: maybe need to enhance the contrast first. otherwise there are too many noise from the background. 

	1.4. tried the Laplacian operator, but the result is worse than the one from high-pass filter. 

		 Comment: 

	1.5. tried the contrast enhancement followed by the hogh-pass filter. the result looks a little bit better than one from the original. 

		 Comment: the noise from the background is still the problem. 

	1.6. maybe can use some mask operation to separate the wire from the background. this might be useful when the weed is green. 


Idea 2: Found a paper about wire or cable detection, and the results looks good, but haven't looked into it.
